# VEIN 5 YEARS OLD!

We celebrate 5 years of VEIN.

The first release 

The first release of VEIN was on October 19, 2016 under a brief period named of REMI. This means that is 5 years this month.  So, the Tuesday 19 of October 2019, at 16:00 Brsilia time, We will have a oresentation **VEIN5** to celebrate 5 years of VEIN. We will have presentation from researchers from Al over Brazil, Ecuador and more. I will prepare a presentation showing the evolution of VEIN and will invite all that want to show some results using VEIN. 5 minutes of presentation. The idea is to share something fun.
